# Web-And-API-Testing-Project

This project involves testing the website https://automationexercise.com/, which has been specifically created for practicing automation coding. The objective of the project is to analyze the website's functionality, derive user stories from it, and create test cases for those user stories.


### Project Description

The project is divided into two sprints: API and Web implementation. The API sprint will focus on testing the website's APIs, while the Web implementation sprint will focus on testing the website's user interface. The goal of the project is to develop a suite of test cases that cover the website's functionality and ensure that it is working as intended.

### Main Objectives
- High quality user stories and test cases

- Fully functional API test framework using Service Object Model/Rest Assured

- Fully functional test framework using POM pattern (Web Testing week-next week)

- Gherkin scenarios that represent the user journeys

- Defect reports

- Exploratory Test Charters

### Project Structure
The project contains two main directories: API and Web Implementation. The API directory contains test cases for testing the website's APIs, while the Web Implementation directory contains test cases for testing the website's user interface. Each directory contains its own set of user stories and test cases.

### User Stories
The user stories for the project are derived from the website's functionality. The user stories are written from the perspective of different types of users, such as a customer or an automation tester. Each user story describes a specific action that the user wants to perform on the website and the reason for performing that action.

### Test Cases
The test cases are created based on the user stories. Each test case is designed to test a specific functionality of the website and ensure that it is working as intended. The test cases are organized by user story and are written in a format that includes the test case ID, name, objective, steps, expected result, test data, test environment, and pass criteria.
